                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>General.</strong>When you use our Website, we receive and collect certain information. The information that we receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit our Website. All data, including Personal Information, is stored in the United States.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal Information.</strong>In order to participate in our online games, you must be registered with LiveAce and open and maintain an account with LiveAce. During registration you are required to provide us with certain contact and personal information, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, home or other physical address, e-mail address, and phone number (“Personal Information”). In addition to Personal Information, we may collect information such as website usage patterns and preferences, transaction history and feedback regarding the Website. If you are engaging in any transaction with a fee, you may be required to provide credit card or debit card information. For purposes of verifying your identity if you are a prize winner, we require a copy of photo identification and Social Security or other tax identification information (for tax purposes). You may also be asked to create your own security question and answer to provide additional security for your account. This required information is necessary to process transactions, to issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, to protect you against credit card fraud and other financial fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account. This information may also be used to send you information relating to our services or promotional offers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aggregate Information.</strong>Some information is automatically received and collected from you when you visit our Website. This information may include some or all of the following items: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using and the IP address of your Internet Service Provider; the type and version of Internet browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our Website, the length of your stay and the specific pages, images, video or forms that you access while visiting the Website; the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, and if applicable, the search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases that you entered into the search engine to find this Website; and geographic information concerning the country of origin and state or territory from which you access our Website (collectively, “Aggregate Information”).</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Profiles and Other Information</strong>You may choose to disclose information, including Personal Information, about yourself through chat functions, message boards, username profiles for public view, or in similar forums on the Website. Information that you disclose through these features is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality there. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of those features. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information, including Personal Information, you choose to submit through these features. In addition, your participation on the Website is conditional upon you agreeing to us collecting, using, storing, transmitting and publicly displaying statistical data (such as your scores, rankings, prizes won and other achievements) generated through your participation on the Website. [Please see our Terms and Conditions for other guidelines about posting content on the Website.]</li>
                    <li><strong>Transactions.</strong>Each time you interact with the Website, the details of such transactions are collected and retained by LiveAce. However, for some payment processors the transactions occur outside of LiveAce and in such instances your details may not be known to us or retained by us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification.</strong>In order to protect against potential fraud and to comply with applicable laws, the information you provide to us may be verified with third parties. In the course of such verification, LiveAce sends and/or receives certain of your Personal Information from such services. Certain third parties may retain your Personal Information and may use it in the future to assist other companies with identity verification. Where LiveAce cannot verify the information that you provide, you may be asked to send additional information to us, such as a copy of your driver's license, passport, other governmental identification, and/or recent bank statement, by facsimile, scan or by mail, to help verify your information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cookies.</strong>As is standard practice on many web sites, we use "cookies" to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Website are the most popular, where our users are going, and how much time they spend there.</li>
                    <li><strong>COPPA Compliance.</strong>The Website is targeted entirely for use by adults. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children under the age of 13 years. In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, in accordance with The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we will delete the child’s personally identifiable information from our files to the extent technologically possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correspondence.</strong>We intend to retain any correspondence, including facsimiles, mail and e-mails, sent to us. We also may retain correspondence, such as customer service e-mails, from LiveAce to you. We may delete such records over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing Data.</strong>You may have the opportunity to participate in demographic surveys and other marketing inquiries in an effort to further improve the use of the Website. Participation in these efforts is voluntary.

                    <p class="desc">
                    LiveAce, our partners and/or our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present advertisements or promotions that appear on our Website and to conduct research about such advertisements or promotions.</p>

                    <h3 class="sec-heading">Informing You</h3>
                    <p class="desc">
                    We may communicate with our customers on a regular basis via e-mail and/or mail to provide requested services, resolve any complaints and for general customer service, and by other means where applicable, such as to investigate any suspicious transactions.

                    <h3 class="sec-heading">Your Profile</h3>
                    <p class="desc">
                        We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and graphic files to create a profile of our customers. We may also purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing customer database so we can better provide pertinent offers in which you might be interested. We use this information to enhance or overlay your profile. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to your Personal Information. A "profile" is stored information that we keep on individual customers that details their preferences. Consequently, all of the collected information is tied to your Personal Information to provide better offers and improve the content of the Website for you. Your individual profile may be used by LiveAce to send you offers from LiveAce and its affiliates or business partners.

                    <h3 class="sec-heading">Security</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Limits of Security Measures.</strong>By creating an account and using the Website, you acknowledge that you understand that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and that we cannot ensure that all of your Personal Information and other private communications will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. You agree that you do not expect that your Personally Information and other private communications will always remain private.</li>
                        <li><strong>Confidentiality Obligation.</strong>The security of your LiveAce account also relies upon your protection of your LiveAce username, account password or other appropriate security codes ("IDs"). You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your IDs and you agree to never share your IDs with anyone.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3 class="sec-heading">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
                    <p class="desc">This Privacy Policy may be periodically updated to reflect changes in laws, regulations, and their interpretation, and, therefore, we reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any revised Privacy Policy will only apply prospectively to your Personally Information collected or modified after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy. You should periodically review this Privacy Policy so you can always be aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, LiveAce discloses it.</p>
